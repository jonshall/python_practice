### Problem

Given an integer array ```nums``` of length ```n``` and an integer ```target```, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
- Return the sum of the three integers.
- Assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

### Example Input

nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1

### Example Output

2

### Explanation

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

### Time Complexity

- O(n^2)

### Space Complexity

- O(1)
