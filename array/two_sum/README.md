# Two Sum

### Problem

Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```target```, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to ```target```.
- Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice
- Return the answer in any order

### Example Input

nums = [2,7,11,15]

target = 9

### Example Output

[0,1]

### Time complexity

- O(n)

### Space complexity

- O(n)
