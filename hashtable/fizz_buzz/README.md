# Fizz Buzz

### Problem

Given an integer ```n```, return a string array ```answer``` (1-indexed) where:
- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if ```i``` is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if ```i``` is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if ```i``` is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == ```i``` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

### Example Input

n = 15

### Example Output

["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

### Time complexity

- O(n)

### Space complexity

- O(1)
